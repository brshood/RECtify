## üî¥ **CRITICAL - Must Complete Before Launch**

### 1. Environment Variables

**Railway Backend** - Verify these are set:
```bash
‚ñ° MONGODB_URI (Atlas connection string)
‚ñ° JWT_SECRET (64+ character random string)
‚ñ° NODE_ENV=production
‚ñ° FRONTEND_URL=https://rectifygo.com

### 2. Test Production Endpoints

**Backend Health Check**:
```bash
curl https://rectify-production.up.railway.app/api/health
```
Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "environment": "production",
  "database": "connected",
  "timestamp": "..."
}
```

‚ñ° Backend health check returns 200 OK

---

### 6. Monitoring Setup (Choose One)

**Option A: Manual Monitoring** (for soft launch):
‚ñ° Railway logs dashboard bookmarked
‚ñ° Can check logs in real-time
‚ñ° MongoDB Atlas alerts configured
‚ñ° Team available during launch

**Option B: Automated Monitoring** (better):
‚ñ° Sentry set up (see MONITORING_SETUP.md)
‚ñ° Better Uptime monitors configured
‚ñ° Alerts going to email/SMS

**For 5-10 users**: Option A is acceptable

---

### 7. Communication Plan

‚ñ° Beta user list prepared (5-10 people)
‚ñ° Launch announcement email drafted
‚ñ° Support email monitored: support@rectifygo.com
‚ñ° Team available for first 24 hours

---

## üü° **IMPORTANT - Should Complete**

### 8. Code Issues

‚ñ° Fix duplicate function in `routes/orders.js` (line 842)
  - Search for `executeTraditionalMatch`
  - Remove duplicate declaration
  - Redeploy

‚ñ° Update test setup.js (remove deprecated MongoDB options)

**Note**: These don't block launch if production code works, but fix soon.

---

### 9. Security Verification

‚ñ° Test rate limiting:
```bash
# Make 101 requests quickly
for ($i=1; $i -le 101; $i++) {
  Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://rectify-production.up.railway.app/api/health"
}
```
Request 101 should return 429 (Too Many Requests)

‚ñ° HTTPS working (green lock icon in browser)
‚ñ° CORS configured (no errors in browser console)

---

### 10. Data Seeding (Optional)

‚ñ° Demo data created (for testing):
```bash
# If needed
cd backend
node scripts/seedDemoData.js
```
