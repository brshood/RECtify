## 2. Blockchain Configuration Decision ✅

### Decision: DISABLE for Soft Launch

**Document**: `BLOCKCHAIN_DECISION.md`

**Key Points**:
- Blockchain recording is **optional** and for audit purposes only
- No cryptocurrency payments involved
- Recommendation: **Disable** for soft launch
- Alternative: Use Sepolia testnet (free) for testing

**Cost Analysis**:
- **Disabled**: $0/month (recommended)
- **Sepolia Testnet**: $0/month (testing only)
- **Ethereum Mainnet**: $1,000-$10,000/month (production, if required)

**Rationale**:
- Focus on core trading functionality first
- Add blockchain audit trail after user validation
- Avoid complexity and costs during soft launch
- Can enable later if compliance requires it

**Implementation**:
```env
# In Railway backend environment variables
BLOCKCHAIN_NETWORK=disabled
# Or simply omit blockchain variables
```

**Future Path**:
1. Soft launch without blockchain (2-4 weeks)
2. Assess compliance requirements
3. Test on Sepolia if needed
4. Deploy to mainnet only if required by regulation
