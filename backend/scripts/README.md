If you get a permission error running the shell script:
```bash
chmod +x backend/scripts/seed-demo-data.sh
./backend/scripts/seed-demo-data.sh
```

## Need More Data?

To customize the demo data:

1. Edit `seedDemoData.js`
2. Modify the arrays:
   - `demoUsers` - User accounts
   - `demoHoldings` - REC holdings
   - `demoOrders` - Active orders
   - Transaction generation code - Historical transactions
3. Run the script again

---

## Production Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: These scripts are for development and testing only!

- Never run seeding scripts on production databases
- Use proper user registration flows in production
- Implement proper data migration strategies
- Always backup before running any data modification scripts

---

## Support

For questions or issues:
- Check the [DEMO_DATA_SUMMARY.md](./DEMO_DATA_SUMMARY.md) for data details
- Review the console output when running scripts
- Check MongoDB connection and logs
- Ensure all dependencies are installed
